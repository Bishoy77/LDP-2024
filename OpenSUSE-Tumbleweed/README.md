## 1. Distribution History

* ### Release date:
    There are two openSUSE distributions: 
    
    Tumbleweed and Leap. openSUSE Tumbleweed, introduced in 2010, adheres to a rolling-release model, whereas openSUSE Leap, introduced in 2015, operates on a fixed release cycle.

* ###  Understanding the Rolling Release model

    In the Linux world, there are two primary release models for distributions:
    
     periodic release and rolling release. Periodic releases deliver major updates at fixed intervals, providing higher stability since all the updates have been tested, while a rolling release provides the latest software versions as they’re released. With a rolling release model, there’s no need for massive upgrades every few months. In this model, the updates are delivered frequently and can be installed at any time, ensuring your system stays updated at any time.

* ### Flavors
    * KDE Plasma
    * GNOME
    * Xfce
    * Also can install other DEs later
*  openSUSE Tumbleweed is based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
